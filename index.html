    <h1 class = "user_experience user-white">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
      if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h1>

    <h4 class = "user_background user-white user-opacity">" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking
      to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
      intro course and found it incredibly fun. I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - 
      and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
      as a Software Engineer at VR startup."
