    <h4 class = "user_background user-white user-opacity">" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking
      to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
      intro course and found it incredibly fun. I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - 
      and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
      as a Software Engineer at VR startup."

        <h4 class = "user_background user-gray user-opacity">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never 
          written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
          about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
          had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took learning
          to the next level in a way no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews
          as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
          after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended! "
